# streaming-anonymous-algorithm
This a dummy platform to implement a streaming anonymous algorithm to protect InputRecord.


## Requirements

### Step 1
1. Application Structure

     ![Class Diagram](./docs/class_diagram.png)
     
2. K-anonymisation Algorithm (1 hour)
    
    1.1 sorted and fix-size aggregation algorithm
    * sort records by rawValue.    
    * split all records into diff group, make sure that there are K records in each group
    * If the number of records is not a multiple of K, those records aggregate into the last group.

3. Stream Windows Strategy
    
    In this version, window's size fixed in the config file.
    
    Next step, dynamic calculation of the size of the window

    2.2 [Stream Windows in Apache Flink]
    


### Step 2 
#### Distortion
1. calculate the mean of the InputRecord's rawValue
2. calculate Mean Variances as A
3. calculate Anonymised Mean Variances as B
4. Distortion = B / A

### Step 3
#### explore the trade-offs between latency and information loss.
